# Katas

On this repository I'll be adding the code of the Kata's I've resolved with a little bit of an explanation so you can understand.

Please note that the languaje I'll be using is Javascript.

# Structure

Per each Kata, you'll find a folder named after the Kata. Inside the folder you'll have a 'problem' named file with the explanation of the problem/task and a .js file with the code.
